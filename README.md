## 🔄 Deep Research Workflow

> A structured, repeatable **3-step process:**

### 1️⃣ Craft a Detailed Prompt
- Be specific: Define the goal, output format, context, and constraints  
- A clear prompt is your **blueprint for success.**

### 2️⃣ Execute Across Multiple AIs
- Run the **same prompt on several AI platforms**  
- Build a "panel of experts" to cross-validate findings  

### 3️⃣ Synthesize & Analyze
- Use synthesis tools like **GenSpark** to consolidate findings  
- Create a unified, well-rounded report
